# Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment140 data set
The goal of the project was to implement a **Deep Neural Network**, using **TensorFlow**, for sentiment analysis of tweets.  

This assignment is part of the "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer" course.

## Deep Neural Network Architecture
The model is comprised of a sequential group of layers, as follows:
- Embedding
- Conv1D
- Dropout
- GlobalAveragePooling1D
- Dense
- Dense

## Data
The original data set is the following:
